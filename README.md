# lstm_lord_of_the_rings
Language Model trained with LSTM using the Lord of The Rings trilogy corpus.

# Character Level modeling
- Two methods were explored:
i) `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` model where the input sentences were vectorized using `TextVectorization` from Keras, yielding input shape of (`MAX_SEQ_LEN`,) where `MAX_SEQ_LEN` is the maximum sequence of the input sentences (Tx). Each individual sequence in the `MAX_SEQ_LEN` would correspond to the vectorized integer number for the corresponding `N_UNIQUE_CHARS` of the corpus (where `N_UNIQUE_CHARS` is the unique characters found in the corpus)
ii) `categorical_crossentropy` model or One-Hot Encoding model where the input sentences were vectorized into one-hot encoded arrays, yielding input shape of (`MAX_SEQ_LEN`, `N_UNIQUE_CHARS`), where `MAX_SEQ_LEN` is the maximum sequence of the input sentences (Tx). For each of the individual sequence in the `MAX_SEQ_LEN` there would be corresponding one-hot-encoded vector of length `N_UNIQUE_CHARS` where N_UNIQUE_CHARS` is the unique characters found in the corpus.
